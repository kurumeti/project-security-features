Security features is a feature of a product, designed to provide access security :lock: for the product. It is really important, especially in Banknotes :moneybag:. <br>
:link: [source]([docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/security-feature#:~:text=Security%20feature%20means%20a%20feature%20of%20a%20product%20designed%20to,Sample%201)) <br>

Security features on **Banknotes** not only used for security, but also help to beautify the banknotes design. Each country issued their banknotes with different type of denominations, which also has different type of security features, based on the value of the banknotes. Usually, the higher the value of banknotes, the more Security Features will planted on it. <br><br>

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this repository, we analyze the security features on Banknotes from 115 countries worldwide. <br>

### LEVELS OF SECURITY FEATURES
There are 3 different level of security features on Banknotes:<br>

1. Level 1 <br> 
   Verifiable by people, can be easily checked by sight, feeling, and moving banknotes <br>
2. Level 2 <br>
   Machine-readable in the commercial market. invisible to naked eye, but can be checked in commercialcash cycle <br>
3. Level 3 <br>
   Exclusive method of authentication in central banks. Optimized for high automation detection in central banks, also for forensic usage. <br>

|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Security Thread Embedded / Windowed | A security feature of many banknotes to protect against counterfeiting, consisting of a thin ribbon that is threaded through the note's paper | ![Embedded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201672353-12e5eb74-cccd-4867-a856-26cfd3148a17.JPG) |
| Watermark | A faint design made in some paper during manufacture that is visible when held against the light and typically identifies the maker | ![Watermark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201673150-43c09a80-7fdb-41af-8636-6197b85837f1.JPG) |
| Metallic Element | An ink containing metallic pigments of bronze and aluminum. When changing the angle of view, while looking at the image applied by metallic ink, glitter intensity changes only | ![Metallic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201673738-09bb9586-eb7e-427a-83de-c42b1027deca.JPG) |
| OVI Ink / Optical Variable Ink | An ink, containing optically variable pigments which change colour depending on the angle of light incidence and view. Applied by intaglio or screen printing | ![OVI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201674081-1efcb120-f542-44c4-aff9-ea0f5b284a15.JPG) ![OVI1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201674136-dfb4eca1-1956-41a4-ab41-5996aba3ebd8.JPG) |
| OVMI Ink / Optical Variable Manetic Ink | A multi-level (visual and machine readable) security feature. The ink contains a special magnetic pigment located with the help of magnetic fields within the ink layer. When the banknote is tilted, there is a combination of the colour changing effect and the dynamic effect of the ink movement (bright parts of the image “change” places). Usually printed by screen printing | ![SPARK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201674968-649f77e4-3e86-404b-bf39-9eac76c901c1.JPG)![SPARK1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201674977-62bd1602-eeaf-46ed-8d9c-28093d402530.JPG) |

| Rainbow Printing | A printing technique, in which two or more inks are applied on one printing plate during the printing process,which results in the formation of intervening tints with smooth colour transitions among the main colours of the image | ![Rainbow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201675790-1b96a168-c709-4bf2-9afd-59e3bfd9331f.JPG) |
| Rectoverso | An image, a part of which is printed on one side of a banknote and the other part on the other side of a banknote. When the banknote is viewed against light, both parts match up and create a complete image | ![rectoverso](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201676028-80f33a57-32a7-4d11-9768-2728398794a9.JPG)![rectoverso1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201676048-a87c47ba-2b2e-4297-b267-8dbb314de879.JPG) |
| Intaglio Print | A printing technique from a plate, where printing elements are incised into the surface. Spacing elements are above the printing ones. A viscous ink fills in the recessed areas of the printing plate and is transferred to the substrate under high pressure (80–100 kg/cm2). The pressure forces the substrate into the recessed areas | ![Intaglio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201676306-2bbc4b45-7cea-4b9a-a188-db7d6fd8a3cd.JPG) |
| Latent Image | An image formed by the parallel lines printed at an angle to the lines of the background. Usually printed by offset. The printing technique and colours of the image and the background are integral and the image in indistinguishable by the naked eye | ![KIPP1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201676594-8daaf12c-348a-4402-8b86-1abc554816b8.JPG) |
| Hologram and Kinegram | A diffractive optically variable device. The holographic image is formed by diffraction and refraction of light on gratings and changes at different angles of illumination and observation | ![holo4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201676844-47158a94-df86-4c49-b944-76e7e3b28843.JPG)`
![holo5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201676880-d652b111-41fb-4076-a605-81326fcd7a61.JPG) |
| Iridescent Ink | A semi-transparent ink with a nacreous glitter. It contains transparent pigments consisting of tiny mica scales covered with a thin film and cause interference of incident light and produces the colour changing effect, when changing the angle of view or entrance. The iridescent element is not seen at right angles | ![Iridescent Ink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201677309-32d212d6-6099-4f58-acdb-c4fe1b4f8740.JPG) |
| Motion | A moving images are framed within rectangular windows of the banknote, appearing and disappearing from the center of the substrate | - |
| Polymer Substrate and Paper | A paper that made from a synthetic polymer such as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) | - |
| Complex Clear Window | A transparent area of the polymer banknote created during the manufacturing process of the substrate, not covered with any coatings | ![Clear Window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201678830-73627f6b-2c8c-4dc1-b4d0-fdb7c3934135.JPG) |
| Embossed Paper | - | - |
| Moire Variable Color | An effect of rainbow image appearance. Differently colored parallel lines are printed by offset before blind embossing. If viewed directly at right angles, the element looks monophonic. If the banknote is tilted, rainbow stripes appear | ![MVC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201679955-88f9c4ef-3ad1-4161-af46-f7f5c2727143.JPG) |
| Diffractive Optical Element WinDOE | An optically variable device that appears in a transparent window and is only visible in transmitted light with the assistance of a distant point light source. The transparent window is transformed into an image (usually a banknote denomination) via light diffraction. This device is unique for its ability to be seen best at night or against dim light | ![WinDOE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201681039-5c3eda34-341c-4b45-9bed-cbd18daf953b.JPG) |

| Invisible Ink | Ink containing fluorescent substances (pigments) which glows when exposed to UV light. The pigments are not visible under normal daylight, only under UV light. The same pigment may have different sensitivity to UV radiation of different spectral ranges. The ink may be used for printing certain graphic elements and general patterns of the banknotes. Security fibers, planchettes, security threads, serial numbers can also fluoresce under UV light | ![Fluorescent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201683315-fdcdc6eb-fcaa-4c96-a472-c414229c8b70.JPG) |
| IR Ink | An ink, containing fluorescent substances (pigments) which glow white when exposed to visible infrared (green) light. The pigments are not visible under normal daylight; can be detected by special devices | ![Metameric1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201683638-5d84d1d6-570b-4434-9243-b291a22dde8a.JPG) |
| Microprinting | A printed image 0,15–0,3 mm high. It is visible only with magnifying devices; can be perceived with the naked eye as a thin continuous line | ![Microtext-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201684010-ab8583b5-dc9e-4dfa-addc-e6cbd79cc5ee.JPG) |
| Metallic Ink | An ink containing metallic pigments of bronze and aluminum. It has a specific metallic glitter. Unlike optically variable ink, when changing the angle of view, while looking at the image applied by metallic ink, glitter intensity changes only. The colour does not change | ![Metallic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201684328-e9c2d887-379c-4a57-a1cd-b85119ea3f25.JPG) |

| Anty-copying | An image constructed of parallel and multidirectional fine lines or raster units. The pattern parameters (direction, width of strokes and the distance among them) impedes reproduction of the images by copying equipment which can be seen as moire or a darker (lighter) text compared with the background. | - |
| Endless Pattern | Identical pattern, printed at the same position, that will create a pattern when we fold it | - |
| Microperforation | A security feature, consisting of micro holes made by laser and forming an image seen in transmitted light (the holes look like bright spots). The area of the banknote with the holes does not feel rough to the touch | ![Microperf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201686971-0acd44b1-103f-49aa-8ff6-e7d0ecb12a61.JPG) |
| Magnetic Thread | An ink containing ferromagnetic components, which have a specific reaction to the external magnetic field. The components can be added to the ink of any colour or colourless varnishes. The texts or images printed by the ink can be identified by special magnetic sensors or visualized by special devices, and used on security threads |![MagneticInk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201687349-713a6226-e456-45c6-b4e2-620d8fbdd07e.JPG)|
| Intaglio Contrast Effect (ICE) | An image printed with special inks by intaglio over the metal coated area of the polymer banknote. The element has an optically variable colour effect: the colours of the image become more contrasting when looking at the banknote at a very sharp angle | ![ICE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201687620-54edfb23-f1ff-4a2c-a4e3-d355ff93afbb.JPG) ![ICE1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113813929/201687643-4e96be7c-6ac7-4229-a611-dac0f2fd0262.JPG) |
